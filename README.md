# TailFreeSampling
Method to sample from autoregressive models for open-ended sequence generation

This implementation is in Tensorflow (tested up to 1.14 but should also work for 2.0). This code should also be trivial to implement in Pytorch.

Check out this blog post for details on the algorithm and its motivations.  <https://trentbrick.github.io/Tail-Free-Sampling/>
